* [Acquire](https://github.com/fox-it/acquire) - Acquire is a tool to quickly gather forensic artifacts from disk images or a live system into a lightweight container. This makes Acquire an excellent tool to, among others, speedup the process of digital forensic triage. It uses [Dissect](https://github.com/fox-it/dissect) to gather that information from the raw disk, if possible.
* [artifactcollector](https://github.com/forensicanalysis/artifactcollector) - The artifactcollector project provides a software that collects forensic artifacts on systems.
* [bulk_extractor](https://github.com/simsong/bulk_extractor) - Computer forensics tool that scans a disk image, a file, or a directory of files and extracts useful information without parsing the file system or file system structures. Because of ignoring the file system structure, the program distinguishes itself in terms of speed and thoroughness.
* [Cold Disk Quick Response](https://github.com/rough007/CDQR) - Streamlined list of parsers to quickly analyze a forensic image file (`dd`, E01, `.vmdk`, etc) and output nine reports.
* [CyLR](https://github.com/orlikoski/CyLR) - The CyLR tool collects forensic artifacts from hosts with NTFS file systems quickly, securely and minimizes impact to the host.
* [Forensic Artifacts](https://github.com/ForensicArtifacts/artifacts) - Digital Forensics Artifact Repository
* [ir-rescue](https://github.com/diogo-fernan/ir-rescue) - Windows Batch script and a Unix Bash script to comprehensively collect host forensic data during incident response.
* [Live Response Collection](https://www.brimorlabs.com/tools/) - Automated tool that collects volatile data from Windows, OSX, and \*nix based operating systems.
* [Margarita Shotgun](https://github.com/ThreatResponse/margaritashotgun) - Command line utility (that works with or without Amazon EC2 instances) to parallelize remote memory acquisition.
* [UAC](https://github.com/tclahr/uac) - UAC (Unix-like Artifacts Collector) is a Live Response collection script for Incident Response that makes use of native binaries and tools to automate the collection of AIX, Android, ESXi, FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, NetBSD, NetScaler, OpenBSD and Solaris systems artifacts.
