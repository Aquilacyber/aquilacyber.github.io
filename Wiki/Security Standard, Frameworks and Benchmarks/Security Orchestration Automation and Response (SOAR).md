[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

SOAR solutions work by prioritizing and standardizing incident response activities so that security teams can collaborate on investigating and managing incidents. Workflows that can be handled through automation go through standardized response processes defined in playbooks.

**SOAR platforms vary depending on vendor, but all of them should include these key features:**

  * **Orchestration:** A SOAR solution can facilitate the connection between security and productivity tools, such as firewalls and intrusion detection tools.
  * **Automation:** A SOAR solution can automate standard cybersecurity workflows, such as the identification of security alerts and possible intrusions.
  * **Response:** A SOAR platform can work with both automated and manual processes to support a timely response to security threats.
  * **Integration:** A SOAR platform can work with a variety of complementary security products to support the organization’s overall security posture.
  * **Playbooks and automation:** SOAR helps security teams use collected data to streamline operations through security automation and the use of playbooks.
  * **Threat prioritization:** SOAR helps security teams prioritize and group alerts for more efficient threat detection and investigation.
  * **Reporting and analysis:** SOAR platforms can generate reports to help security teams identify trends in their organization.
  * **Security dashboard:** SOAR platforms can serve as a central dashboard to help security teams monitor and respond to alerts in a collaborative way.
