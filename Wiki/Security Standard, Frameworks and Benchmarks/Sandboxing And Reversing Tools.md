### Sandboxing/Reversing Tools

[Back to Top](#table-of-contents)

**Sandboxing** - is a security practice in which you use an isolated environment, or a "sandbox," for testing. Within the sandbox you run code, analyze the code in a safe, isolated environment without affecting the application, system or platform.

**Reverse-engineering** - is the process of dismantling a device, system, or piece of software to see how it works. It's done primarily to analyze and gain knowledge about the way a product works but often is used to duplicate or enhance the product.
