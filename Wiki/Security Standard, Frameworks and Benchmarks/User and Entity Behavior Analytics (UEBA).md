### User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA)

[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)

User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) is a category of security solutions that use innovative analytics technology, including machine learning and deep learning, to discover abnormal and risky behavior by users, machines and other entities on the corporate network with a Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) solution.

#### Three pillars of UEBA

**Gartner defines UEBA solutions across three dimensions:**

  * **Use cases** — UEBA solutions provide information on the behavior of users and other entities in the corporate network. They should perform monitoring, detection and alerting of anomalies. And they should be applicable for multiple use cases–unlike specialized tools for employee monitoring, trusted hosts monitoring, fraud, and so on.
  * **Data sources** — UEBA solutions are able to ingest data from a general data repository such as a data lake or data warehouse, or through a SIEM. They shouldn't deploy agents directly in the IT environment to collect the data.
  * **Analytics** — UEBA solutions detect anomalies using a variety of analytics approaches–statistical models, machine learning, rules, threat signatures and more.

There is a close relation between UEBA and SIEM technologies, because UEBA relies on cross-organizational security data to perform its analyses, and this data is typically collected and stored by a SIEM.

**A UEBA solution should analyze as many data sources as possible, some example data sources include:**

 * Authentication systems like [Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview)
 * Access systems like VPN and proxies
 * Configuration Management Databases
 * Human resources data–new employees, departed employees, and any data that provides additional context on users
 * Firewall, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)
 * Anti-malware and antivirus systems
 * Endpoint Detection and Response systems
 * Network Traffic Analytics
 * Threat Intelligence feeds
