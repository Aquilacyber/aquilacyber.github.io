**SIEM software goals:**

  * Report on security incidents and events. The software can provide reports with event data, such as failed logins and malware activity.
  * Send alerts about potential security issues. The software can use set parameters to determine whether an event is a potential security issue.   
  * An overview of notable events in your environment that represent potential security incidents.
  * Details of all notable events identified in your environment, so you can undertake triage.
  * A workbook of all open investigations, allowing you to track your progress and activity while investigating multiple security incidents.
  * Risk analysis that lets you score systems and users across your network to identify risks.
  * Threat intelligence designed to add context to your security incidents and identify known malicious actors in your environment.
  * Protocol intelligence using captured packet data to provide network insights that are relevant to your security investigations, allowing you to identify suspicious traffic, DNS activity and email activity.
  * User intelligence lets you investigate and monitor the activity of users and assets in your environment.
  * Web intelligence to analyze web traffic in your network.   
    
**SIEM Data sources include:**

  * **Network devices:** Routers, switches, bridges, wireless access points, modems, line drivers, hubs
  * **Servers:** Web, proxy, mail, FTP
  * **Security devices:** IDP/IPS, firewalls, antivirus software, content filter devices, intrusion detection appliances
  * **Applications:** Any software used on any of the above devices
  * **Cloud and SaaS solutions:** Software and services not hosted on-premises
  * **Remote workforce:** All devices and activity related to remote work
