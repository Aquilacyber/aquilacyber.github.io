  * **Symmetric** is a data encryption method whereby the same private key is used to encode and decode information.
  
  * **Asymmetric** is a data encryption method that allows users to encrypt information using shared keys. For example, if you need to send a message across the internet, but you don't want anyone but the intended recipient to see what you've written.
 
 **Types of Encryption**
 
  * **Triple DES (Triple Data Encryption Algorithm)** is a symmetric-key block cipher, which applies the DES cipher algorithm three times to each data block(contains 64 bits of data).
  
  * **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** is an algorithm that encrypts and decrypts data in blocks of 128 bits. It can do this using 128-bit, 192-bit, or 256-bit keys.
  
  * **RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)** is a type of public-key cryptography used for secure data transmission of e-mail and other digital transactions over the Internet. 
  
   * **Twofish**  is a symmetric key block cipher with a block size of 128 bits and key sizes up to 256 bits. It is an advanced version of Blowfish encryption.
  
  * **Format Preserving Encryption (FPE)** is a valid encryption algorithm to be used for compliance with NIST standards. It is mostly used in on-premise encryption and tokenization solutions.
 
 **Application Level Encryption**
 
  * **Hashes** is a function that converts an input of letters and numbers into an encrypted output of a fixed length. For example, algorithms such as [MD5 (Message Digest 5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5) or [SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_hash_algorithms).
  
  * **Digital Certificates** is a file that verifies the identity of a device or user and enables encrypted connections. A digital signature is a hashing approach that uses a numeric string to provide authenticity and validate identity. Digital certificates are typically issued by a **certificate authority (CA)**, which is a trusted third-party entity that issues digital certificates for use by other parties.
