# Summary
A bug bounty hunter is an individual who knows the nuts and bolts of cybersecurity and is well familiar with finding bugs or flaws. Simply put, a bug bounty hunter tests applications and platforms and looks for bugs that sometimes even the in-house development team fails to spot. Once spotting a bug, these professionals inform the company (or the concerned body behind the application or the platform) about the bug and in return, they get paid. The benefits are not always monetary.
