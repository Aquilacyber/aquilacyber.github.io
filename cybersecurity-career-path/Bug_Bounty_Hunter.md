# Summary

A bug bounty hunter is an expert in cybersecurity who excels in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities within applications and platforms. These professionals play a crucial role in testing systems for flaws that may go undetected by internal development teams. Upon discovering vulnerabilities, bug bounty hunters responsibly disclose them to the organization or entity behind the application or platform, often receiving compensation. The rewards for bug bounty hunters extend beyond monetary gain, including recognition and contribution to global cybersecurity efforts.
